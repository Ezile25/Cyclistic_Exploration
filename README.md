#### Key Observations
##### Weekday Usage:
Members consistently have higher ride counts throughout the week compared to casual users.
Casual users see a significant increase in rides on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, suggesting weekend leisure rides are popular.
##### Peak Usage:
Members have a peak in rides on Wednesday and Thursday. This could indicate a pattern of commuting or regular weekday usage.
Casual users have the highest ride counts on Saturday, followed by Sunday. This suggests that weekends are the prime time for casual bike rides.
##### Inferences
Member users likely have a more consistent usage pattern, possibly for commuting or regular exercise.
Casual users tend to ride on weekends for leisure or recreational purposes.
The bike share service might consider targeted promotions or incentives to encourage more casual users to ride during weekdays.
